\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Let $P=\{(x_1,x_2) : x_1 - x_2 = 0,~ x_1 + x_2 = 0\}$. What are the extreme points and the extreme rays of $P$?
	\item[(b)] Let $P=\{(x_1,x_2) : 4x_1 + 2x_2 \geq 0,~ 2x_1 + x_2 \leq 1\}$. What are the extreme points and the extreme rays of $P$?
	\item[(c)] For the polyhedron of part (b), is it possible to express each one of its elements as a convex combination of its extreme points plus a nonnegative linear combination of its extreme rays? Is this compatible with the Resolution Theorem?
